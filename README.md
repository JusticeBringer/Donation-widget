# Donation widget

Implement the design for the box in the below image:
https://d3vbj265bmdenw.cloudfront.net/public/uploads/2017-10/ee77fafe89f39c0f4eb937aa241f02ac.png

Width must have a maximum of 450px.
Hover must be visible - Implementation of your choice.
Needs to also look good on mobile (responsive design).
You need to stick to the design as much as possible, moreover, the box needs to be interactive.

A user should be able to use it as if it’s an actual donation widget.

### Implementation

Implementation can be seen live [here](https://justicebringer.github.io/Donation-widget/).

I have added following bonuses:

- On initial load the donation bar increases width with transition effect
- Every donation makes the donation bar increase width with transition effect
- When money are no longer needed the „Tell your friends” button receives a beautiful border animation
- You can donate not only 50$ but whatever amount you want. Included validation for user input.

### Technologies used

- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript ES6
